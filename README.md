🧠 AIPowered Mental Health Screening & Clinical Support System

 📌 Overview

This project is an AIdriven mental health assessment toolkit that combines validated clinical questionnaires with advanced NLP techniques to provide early detection, crisis assessment, and personalized recommendations. It is designed to support both individuals and mental health professionals by offering instant insights, structured reports, and professional resources.

The system integrates:

 Questionnaires: PHQ9 (depression) & GAD7 (anxiety).
 NLP Analysis: Detects emotional intensity, depression, anxiety, and risk indicators from freetext input.
 Crisis Detection: Identifies immediate/high/moderate risk levels and generates safety plans.
 Recommendations: Personalized resources, therapy suggestions, and professional services.
 Reporting: Interactive risk visualizations and downloadable clinical PDF reports.



 🌍 RealWorld Problem Solved

Mental health issues often go undiagnosed due to stigma, lack of access to professionals, or delayed response in crises. This system provides an accessible, AIassisted first step:

 Helps individuals recognize potential risks and access relevant resources immediately.
 Assists clinicians with structured assessments, patient tracking, and professional summaries.
 Supports crisis intervention by generating safety protocols and referral letters.

By combining clinical psychology tools with AI, the project aims to bridge the gap between awareness and professional care, ultimately reducing untreated mental health crises.
